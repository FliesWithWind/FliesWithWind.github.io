                <h2>About Neurohackweek</h2>
                <p>Neurohackweek is a 5-day hands-on workshop in neuroimaging and data science. Participants will learn about technologies used to analyze human neuroscience data, and make analysis and results shareable and reproducible.</p>
                <p>Morning sessions will be devoted to hands-on lectures and afternoon sessions will be devoted to participant-directed activities: hackathon and breakout sessions on topics of interest</p>
                <p>This format is inspired by <a href="http://astrohackweek.github.io/">astrohackweek</a>, a similar program focused on astrophysics.
