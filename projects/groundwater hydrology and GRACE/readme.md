### Project Title: Data exploration using GRACE remotely derived groundwater levels and well point datasets 


#### The problem

If the well is dry, is the problem due to hydrology or humans?  Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are three countries with an extensive well dataset.  What are the spatial statistics of failures? Are functioning/non-functioning wells scattered randomly, or does failure follow a hydrologic pattern? 

A common challenge in interpreting and validating remote sensing data is in comparing these data to direct observations on the ground. Often remotely sensed data will cover large regions and have different temporal and spatial sampling frequency than point observations derived in the field. This kind of analysis requires geospatial tools to enable resampling, assessment of spatial statistics and extrapolation of point data to broader regions.  In Geohackweek 2016, our project team ('Oh Well') left code to explore this problem on HydroShare ([Freshwaterhack: Groundwater Resources and GRACE](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/8f74613935e84dcb9e4958229778f267/)).  We've got a great start, but there is more to be done!  


#### Application Example

The integration of satellite missions (GRACE) with hydrology models for determining drought indicators and water levels has been done in the United States (Houborg, et al., 2012; Zaitchick et al., 2008) using data assimilation from sophisticated observatory networks that are not available, for example, in sub-saharan Africa.  However, there are studies that have analyzed operational, technical, institutional, financial, and environmental predictors of functionality for groundwater access (well) data collected from over 25,000 community-managed handpumps in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda (Foster, 2013). Lahren and Cook (2016) code and analyze the reasons for failure in 250,000 water points in 25 countries and found that 30% of boreholes are not functioning, either for "technical or mechanical” reasons, or for "low quantity".   According to the World Bank, water supply failure in Africa is estimated to “represent a lost investment in excess of $1.2 billion” (Bonsor et. al. 2015).  Women and girls continue to be the world’s water collectors, spending a significant fraction of their time and energy on the task (Sorenson et al 2011, Graham et al 2016, Cook et al 2016). Can a planetary scale observational tool be used to understand groundwater access and vulnerability for domestic use in rural households? If so, we can further investigate and develop the GRACE for Girls project.

In recent years, NGOs, as well as governments and academics, have begun collecting water point data in an effort to not only monitor functionality, but to understand the relationship between determining factors and failure of handpumps.   “Low quantity” is cited as a reason in 43% of failed boreholes (where some failure reason was given) in Lahren and Cook (2016).  But poor yield can be due to a number of different factors, including poor siting, mechanical failure, or hydrological scarcity. The proposed project will attempt to leverage externally-derived measures of groundwater abstraction using GRACE to determine what fraction of non-functionality can reasonably be attributed to falling groundwater levels and low water availability. 

These spatial datasets provide new opportunities to: 
1. understand the relationship between GRACE water level trends near the approximately 13,000 well point records that have been identified by Lahren and Cook (2016) as failing due to a hydrologic deficit/low quantity. 
2. understand the correlation between well functionality status and GRACE water level trends in locations where GRACE estimates show decreasing trends.


#### Research Questions

How much is hydrological scarcity contributing to handpump failure in Africa?

1. In areas where domestic water access is primarily through wells, are areas with non-functional wells because of low quantity observable with remote sensing data?  
2. What spatial statistics can be used to understand the reasons for well failure using geolocated water points and  falling groundwater levels? 

#### Sample data
Point data: The Water Point Data Exchange ([WPDx](https://www.waterpointdata.org/)) is a global platfrom for sharing water point data to understand water services with 240,000 + water points in the dataset with the quantity of data varying between government support for complete datasets (all 101,000 water points in Uganda) as well as data in other countries with known GRACE observable groundwater levels (India).  

The WPDx data downloaded in February 2016, and coded for well failure due to water resources issues (Lahren and Cook (2016)), is provided on [Hydroshare](www.hydroshare.org). Go to Collaborate.

Remote sensing data: The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ([GRACE](http://www.csr.utexas.edu/grace/), a joint mission of NASA and the German Aerospace Center) measures the Earth's gravity anomalies to study how mass is distributed around the planet and used for studying Earth's eceans, geology, and climate.

#### Project Ideas 

1. Identify and use spatial statistics to characterize well data with well failure due to a hydrologic deficit/low quantity. Identify whether a spatial correlation exists between non-functional wells and decreasing groundwater trends from GRACE. 

2. Identify and use spatial statistics to characterize where GRACE predicts decreasing groundwater trends. Explore the WPDx data variables and locations to identify any correlations. 

3. Identify any country-specific correlations or trends in the well point database and GRACE. 

#### Existing methods

Comparison of point and array datasets is often carried out using GIS tools.  People have used this point dataset, and similar datasets, mainly to classify points as functioning or not functioning and then try to look for trends or correlates.  Lahren and Cook (2106) are the only ones that we know of that tried to use the failure reasons from the database, in part because there are no centralized definitions and took forever to manually code.  We also do not know of any work to date linking hydrologic conditions to failure reasons.
