Brief title describing the proposed work.

#### Collaborators on this project

_List all participants on the project. Choose one team member to act as project lead, and identify one geohack organizer as the data science lead._

#### The problem

What geospatial problem are you going to explore? Provide a few sentences. If this is a technical exploration of software or data science methods, explain why this work is important in a broader context.

#### Application Example

List one specific application of this work.

#### Sample data   

If you already have some data to explore, briefly describe it here (size, format, how to access).

#### Specific Questions 

List the specific tasks you want to accomplish or research questions you want to answer.
